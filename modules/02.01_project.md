# Trash Level Classification

### Exploratory Data Analysis and Modeling

This section provides code for downloading the CleanStat dataset from the City of LA open data portal and complete exploratory data analysis, aka [EDA][02.00]. EDA includes reviewing the dataset dimensions, distribution and feature correlation.

After EDA, the modeling is completed using the python [scikit-learn][02.01] library to train/test a random forest classifier. Results are evaluated using a confusion matrix, and code is available to encourage additional development/collaboration.
