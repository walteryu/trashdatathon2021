# Trash Datathon 2021

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Modeling

Welcome to the 2021 Trash Datathon! Purpose of this notebook will be to provide an example application of machine learning for trash level score classification using the City of LA [CleanStat][01.00] dataset from their open data portal. CleanStat is part of a larger city initiative to address litter, and additional info is provided in this [factsheet][01.01].

This notebook is based an introductory template from Google Colab, so listed below are instructions for those who are new to Colab, Jupyter or Python followed by the example application under its own section. All sections can be navigated within the notebook.

Please note that this notebook is intended as a brief introduction to AI/ML modeling and examples are provided to encourage additional development/collaboration.
